# DEPRECATED: for backward compatibility until openstack/control.yml migrate to
# check_multiple_processes.yml
#
# This instance is needed for the example case, where on control node the GlusterFS is deployed with keepalived and
# a `remote_agent` from `Stacklight` sends its queries to the control's VIP to gather the GlusterFS data.
# In case of `glusterd` process failure, the VIP should be moved to another node, to prevent `remote_agent` from failing.
# In addition, check for haproxy process too, as on its failure VIP should be also moved to another node.
