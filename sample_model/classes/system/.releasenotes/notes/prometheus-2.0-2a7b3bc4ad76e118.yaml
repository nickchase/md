  Updated the StackLight components to newer versions

upgrade:
  - |
    Updated the following StackLight components:

    - Prometheus server to version 2.0.0
    - Alertmanager to version 0.11.0
    - Pushgateway to version 0.4.0

    .. important::

       The new version of Prometheus is not backward compatible
       with previous versions. Therefore, you must upgrade the
       monitoring stack as described in the MCP Operations Guide.

    To continue using Prometheus v1.7, add the following snippet
    to the Reclass model of your MCP deployment. However, Mirantis
    recommends that you update your monitoring stack to obtain new
    features such as performance improvements.
